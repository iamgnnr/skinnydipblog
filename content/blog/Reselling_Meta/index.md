Ubuweb is a digital archive that provides free access to a vast collection of avant-garde and experimental art, music, and literature. The archive was founded in 1996 by Kenneth Goldsmith, an American poet, and conceptual artist. Since then, Ubuweb has become a renowned resource for scholars, artists, and anyone interested in exploring the outer reaches of creative expression.

Below I've selected a few gems from their massive collection of videos, writings, and sound recordings. Enjoy!
