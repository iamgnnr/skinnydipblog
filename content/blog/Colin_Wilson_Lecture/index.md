Colin Wilson was an English writer and philosopher who wrote over 100 books on topics such as existentialism, crime and mysticism. He was best known for his 1956 work The Outsider, a survey of famous outsiders in literature and history. Wilson's works often focused on the idea of using the power of the will to explore the human psyche and to take control of one's life. Wilson also wrote extensively on the paranormal, occult, and supernatural and was a lifelong advocate of the power of the imagination. Below I've linked to a 1996 Lecture given by Colin Wilson entitled "Atlantis to the Sphinx".
